Multi-modal neural networks have become increasingly pervasive in today's AI application domains due to their superior accuracy by fusing various modalities. However, they present many unique characteristics such as multi-stage execution, frequent synchronization and high heterogeneity, which are not well understood in the system and architecture community. In this project, we aim to present and characterize a set of multi-modal neural network workloads of different sizes at inference stage. We also target on exploring their important implications from system and architecture aspects. We hope that our work can help guide future software/hardware
design and optimization for efficient inference of multi-modal DNN applications.

These power-oriented attacks impel us to think about how APDCs can maintain their benefits in a potentially insecure operating environment. To defend against power-oriented attacks, I propose to optimize traditional power management frameworks with cross-layer designs, such as orchestrating network balancers and power managers to prevent DOPE attack. -->
