To meet the needs of multi-modal applications, intelligent datacenters have shifted from the traditional monolithic datacenter architecture to a hybrid architecture of monolithic datacenters and edge micro datacenters. Generally,intelligent datacenters combine a large number of data perception modules to obtain data of different modalities. At the same time, they integrate and extend more dedicated computing modules to accelerate data computation.

Our IPAD design creates a hybrid energy backup pool for managing complex power anomalies. It exploits the energy stored in both batteries and super-capacitors. The batteries form a virtualized energy backup pool called virtual DEB (vDEB). The supercapacitors form a micro energy backup pool called micro-DEB (Î¼DEB). The vDEB module aims at protecting data centers from a brute visible peak attack in the Level-1 emergency state. The vDEB design intends to defend against a more sophisticated hidden spike often seen in the Level-2 state.
