I am currently a Post-doctoral Fellow in <a href="https://hkg.databasesets.com/zh-hans/gongsimingdan/number/2927539">AI Chip Center for Emerging Smart Systems (ACCESS)</a>. At ACCESS, I am honored to work with <a href="https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/about/people/faculty/tim-kwang-ting-cheng">Prof. Tim CHENG</a>. Prior to joining ACCESS, I received my PhD degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, supervised by  <a href="https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~lichao/index.html">Prof. Chao Li</a>. I earned my BS degree from Dalian University of Technology. (with honors).

My primary research areas are chip implementation, architecture design and system optimization to improve performance and energy efficiency of different computing systems including IoT devices, cloud servers and data centers. My broader interests also include emerging technologies and evolving applications that could ultimately shape the next-generation compters.

<!-- **My research interests include**:

**Highly-Ecient Cloud Platforms**: Architecture design and system optimization for better utilizing power resource to improve performance as well as energy eciency of both existing and emerging applications running on cloud platforms.

**Highly-Available Computer Systems**: Resilient power and energy optimization frameworks for protecting computer systems from a malicious adversary who exploits the vulnerabilities within aggressive power provisioning and management schemes.

**Highly-Scalable Data Centers**: Cross-layer designs of managing various heterogeneous power infrastructures and computing components to put the energy-saving limits of current data centers for supporting scale-out workloads and servers. -->
