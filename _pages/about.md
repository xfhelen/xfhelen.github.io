### Education Background
>
>> I am currently a Post-doctoral Fellow in AI Chip Center for Emerging Smart Systems (ACCESS). In ACCESS, I am honored to work with <a href="https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/about/people/faculty/tim-kwang-ting-cheng">Prof. Kwang-Ting CHENG</a>. Prior to joining ACCESS, I received my PhD degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University under the joint supervision of <a href="https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~guo-my">Prof. Minyi Guo</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~lichao/index.html">Prof. Chao Li</a>. I earned my BS degree from Dalian University of Technology (with honors).

<!-- My primary research areas include architecture/system optimization techniques to provide the optimal tradeoff between performance (e.g., latency, accuracy, QoS, etc.) and energy efficiency for computing systems of different sizes including IoT devices, cloud servers, etc. 


My broader research interests include: power/energy management, smart architectures/systems, sustainable computing platforms, available/scalable infrastructures, carbon neutrality, etc. -->

### Research Interests
>
>> My primary research interest is in designing and implementing cross-layer optimization techniques for improving the energy efficiency of computing systems of different sizes, ranging from AIoT sensors to cloud servers. 
>> My broader interests include power and energy management, AI infrastructures, autonomous architecture and system designs, sustainable computing, carbon neutrality, etc. 
>> **I am currently focusing on deploying and implementing highly energy-efficient intelligent datacenters through cross-layer optimization for multi-modal AI applications.**

<!-- to design and implement next-genegration, green computers. -->
<!-- also include emerging technologies and evolving applications that could ultimately shape the next-generation computers. -->

<!-- **My research interests include**:

**Highly-Ecient Cloud Platforms**: Architecture design and system optimization for better utilizing power resource to improve performance as well as energy eciency of both existing and emerging applications running on cloud platforms.

**Highly-Available Computer Systems**: Resilient power and energy optimization frameworks for protecting computer systems from a malicious adversary who exploits the vulnerabilities within aggressive power provisioning and management schemes.

**Highly-Scalable Data Centers**: Cross-layer designs of managing various heterogeneous power infrastructures and computing components to put the energy-saving limits of current data centers for supporting scale-out workloads and servers. -->
