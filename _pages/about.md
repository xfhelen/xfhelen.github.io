I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU).  At SJTU, I'm a member of Emerging Parallel Computing Center (<a href="http://epcc.sjtu.edu.cn/">EPCC</a>) and Sustainable Architecture and Infrastructure Lab (<a href="https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/sail/">SAIL</a>). Prior to joining SJTU, I worked with <a href="https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/about/people/faculty/tim-kwang-ting-cheng">Prof. Kwang-Ting CHENG</a> at the AI Chip Center for Emerging Smart Systems (ACCESS), Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). I earned my PhD degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University under the joint supervision of <a href="https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~lichao/index.html">Prof. Chao Li</a> and  <a href="https://cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~guo-my/">Prof. Minyi Guo</a>. I earned my BS degree from Dalian University of Technology (with honors).

<!-- My primary research areas include architecture/system optimization techniques to provide the optimal tradeoff between performance (e.g., latency, accuracy, QoS, etc.) and energy efficiency for computing systems of different sizes including IoT devices, cloud servers, etc. 


My broader research interests include: power/energy management, smart architectures/systems, sustainable computing platforms, available/scalable infrastructures, carbon neutrality, etc. -->

<!-- 
My primary research interest is in implementing energy-efficient system and architecture co-design for smart computing platforms of different sizes, ranging from autonomous AIoT sensors to intelligent datacenters. 


My broader interests include microscale, hyperscale and hybrid datacenters, power and energy management, automated architecture and system designs, sustainable computing, carbon neutrality, etc.  -->
<!-- My primary research focus is on developing efficient system and architecture co-design techniques for intelligent computing platforms spanning different scales. These platforms include autonomous sensors for the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) as well as advanced datacenters. My research also encompasses a wide range of topics such as power and energy management, automated architecture and system designs, sustainable computing, carbon neutrality, etc. In addition, I am interested in studying microscale, hyperscale, and hybrid datacenters to understand their unique non-computing and computing requirements. -->

**A Message for Prospective Students:**


I'm looking for bright and self-motivated PhD, Master and Undergraduate students who have a strong interest in computer architecture and system design. 
<!-- I'm interested in new colleagues at all levels: undergraduates and garduddate students (MS/PhD). -->

If you want to work with me (or just discuss your brilliant idea with me), please feel free to send me an email [xfhelen (at) gmail.com] along with your CV to arrange an appointment.
<!-- **I am currently focusing on deploying and implementing highly energy-efficient intelligent datacenters through cross-layer optimization for multi-modal AI applications.** -->

<!-- to design and implement next-genegration, green computers. -->
<!-- also include emerging technologies and evolving applications that could ultimately shape the next-generation computers. -->

<!-- **My research interests include**:

**Highly-Ecient Cloud Platforms**: Architecture design and system optimization for better utilizing power resource to improve performance as well as energy eciency of both existing and emerging applications running on cloud platforms.

**Highly-Available Computer Systems**: Resilient power and energy optimization frameworks for protecting computer systems from a malicious adversary who exploits the vulnerabilities within aggressive power provisioning and management schemes.

**Highly-Scalable Data Centers**: Cross-layer designs of managing various heterogeneous power infrastructures and computing components to put the energy-saving limits of current data centers for supporting scale-out workloads and servers. -->
