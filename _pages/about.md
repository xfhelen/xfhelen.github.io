I am currently a Post-doctoral Fellow in AI Chip Center for Emerging Smart Systems (ACCESS). In ACCESS, I am honored to work with <a href="https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/about/people/faculty/tim-kwang-ting-cheng">Prof. Tim Kwang-Ting CHENG</a>. Prior to joining ACCESS, I received my PhD degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, supervised by  <a href="https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~lichao/index.html">Prof. Chao Li</a>. I earned my BS degree from Dalian University of Technology. (with honors).

My primary research areas include chip implementation, architecture design and system optimization to improve energy efficiency of different-size computing systems including IoT devices, cloud servers, etc. 

My broader interests include emerging technologies and evolving applications that could ultimately lead to the next-generation green computers.

<!-- to design and implement next-genegration, green computers. -->
<!-- also include emerging technologies and evolving applications that could ultimately shape the next-generation computers. -->

<!-- **My research interests include**:

**Highly-Ecient Cloud Platforms**: Architecture design and system optimization for better utilizing power resource to improve performance as well as energy eciency of both existing and emerging applications running on cloud platforms.

**Highly-Available Computer Systems**: Resilient power and energy optimization frameworks for protecting computer systems from a malicious adversary who exploits the vulnerabilities within aggressive power provisioning and management schemes.

**Highly-Scalable Data Centers**: Cross-layer designs of managing various heterogeneous power infrastructures and computing components to put the energy-saving limits of current data centers for supporting scale-out workloads and servers. -->
